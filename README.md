- Optimize for **mobile and desktop responsiveness**.
- Highlight important features like pricing, availability, and location clearly.
- Provide a smooth and frictionless **checkout process**.

### Importance of a User-Friendly Design in a Booking System
A user-friendly design is critical in a booking system because it:
- **Builds trust** by presenting information clearly and professionally.
- **Reduces friction**, allowing users to complete bookings efficiently.
- **Prevents errors** with clear forms and guided interactions.
- **Enhances satisfaction**, increasing the likelihood of return users and positive reviews.
- **Improves conversion rates**, as users are more likely to complete bookings when the process is intuitive.

Investing in UI/UX design ensures that users find the platform easy, fast, and pleasant to useâ€”key traits of a successful digital booking experience.
